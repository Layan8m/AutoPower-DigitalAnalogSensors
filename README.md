# AutoPower-DigitalAnalogSensors
Arduino projects: A latching power switch with auto shut-off, and a sensor system using both digital and analog sensors.
## ðŸ“Œ Tasks

### 1. Latching Power Switch with Auto Power Off
A circuit that simulates a toggle (latching) switch:
- Press the button to turn on a device (e.g., LED).
- If left on, it turns off automatically after a set period (e.g., 10 seconds).
- Useful in power-saving applications.

Components Used:
- Arduino UNO
- Pushbutton
- LED 
- Resistors

### 2. Sensor System with Digital and Analog Sensors
- Digital Sensor
- Analog Sensor


- If digital sensor is triggered â†’ LED turns on.
- If analog sensor reads a value above a threshold â†’ buzzer activates.
